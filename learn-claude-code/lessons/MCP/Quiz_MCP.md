1. You're building an MCP client to connect your application to an MCP server. What are the two main components you need?

- A frontend and a backend
- A database and a web server
- A REST API and a GraphQL endpoint
- ✅ An MCP Client class and a Client Session

2. Your MCP client needs to find out what tools are available from an MCP server. What message type should it send?

- ✅ ListToolsRequest
- CallToolRequest
- ToolDiscoveryRequest
- GetToolsMessage

3. You've built an MCP server and want to test if your tools work correctly before connecting to a full application. What's the easiest way to do this?

- Write separate test scripts for each tool
- Test everything manually in the terminal
- ✅ Use the built-in MCP Inspector with `mcp dev mcp_server.py`
- Connect directly to Claude first

4. You're building a chat app where users ask Claude about their GitHub data. Without MCP, what's the main problem you'd face?

- GitHub doesn't allow API access
- ✅ You'd have to write and maintain all the GitHub tool code yourself
- Claude can't understand GitHub data
- Users can't ask questions about repositories

5. You're deciding how to implement a new feature in your MCP server. Users should be able to click a button to trigger a "summarize document" workflow. Which MCP primitive should you use?

- Resources - because you need to fetch document data
- Functions - because it involves processing
- ✅ Prompts - because users control when to start the workflow
- Tools - because the AI needs new capabilities

6. You're using the Python MCP SDK to create a tool that reads files. What's the easiest way to define this tool?

- ✅ Use the @mcp.tool() decorator on a Python function
- Create a separate configuration file
- Write JSON schemas manually
- Send HTTP requests to register the tool

7. You want to create a resource that fetches different documents based on their ID, like docs://documents/report.pdf. What type of resource should you use?

- ✅ A templated resource with parameters in the URI
- A tool instead of a resource
- A direct resource with a static URI
- A database query resource
