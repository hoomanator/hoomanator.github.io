12. You're running a prompt evaluation. After getting responses from Claude, what's the next step in the typical workflow?

- Rewrite the prompt completely from scratch
- Create a new dataset with different questions
- Deploy the prompt to production immediately
- ✅ Feed the responses through a grader for scoring

13. You ask Claude "What is pizza?" and it answers. Then you ask "What toppings are popular?" but Claude doesn't know you're still talking about pizza. What's the problem?

- ✅ You need to send the whole conversation history with each request
- Claude doesn't like pizza
- Claude is broken
- You're asking too many questions

14. What is the primary difference between an MCP Server and an MCP Client in terms of their roles?

- ✅ MCP Servers contain tools, prompts, and resources while MCP Clients act as the communication bridge to access those tools
- MCP Servers handle user authentication while MCP Clients manage permissions
- MCP Servers store data while MCP Clients process requests
- MCP Servers run on remote machines while MCP Clients only run locally

15. Which of the following best describes Computer Use in the context of Claude?

- A method for deploying Claude applications to cloud servers
- A billing system that tracks how much computational time Claude consumes
- ✅ A capability that lets Claude interact directly with desktop environments like a human would
- A feature that optimizes Claude's processing speed on different hardware

16. What does "transport agnostic" mean in the context of MCP communication?

- ✅ MCP clients and servers can communicate using different methods like HTTP or standard input/output
- MCP only works with encrypted connections
- MCP automatically chooses the fastest available network connection
- MCP requires specific hardware to function properly

17. What is the primary purpose of a batch tool in Claude's tool system?

- ✅ To accept multiple tool calls and execute them simultaneously
- To encrypt multiple tool calls for security purposes
- To process large files that exceed normal size limits

18. Claude responds to your request with both explanatory text and a tool use block. What type of message structure is this?

- An error message that needs to be fixed
- ✅ A multi-block message with different content types
- A single-block text message

20. When should you choose workflows over agents for handling user tasks?

- When you're not sure what tasks or parameters you'll give to Claude
- When you need maximum flexibility in task completion
- When you want Claude to creatively combine tools in unexpected ways

21. Which of the following best describes why environment inspection is crucial for AI agents?

- It helps agents run faster and more efficiently
- ✅ It allows agents to observe and understand the results of their actions
- It simplifies the agent's tool requirements
- It reduces the cost of running AI operations

The correct answer is: It allows agents to observe and understand the results of their actions.

Why Environment Inspection is Crucial
In AI agent architectures (such as standard ReAct or agentic feedback loops), execution isn't a one-way street. Environment inspection enables:

Observation & Feedback: After taking an action (e.g., executing code, querying a database, or interacting with a web page), the agent must inspect the updated environment state to verify if the action succeeded or failed.

Dynamic Decision-Making: Observing output, error messages, or state changes allows the agent to adjust its plan, fix errors, or determine the next best step dynamically.

Grounding: It prevents hallucinations by tying the agent's next steps to real, verifiable environment results rather than assumptions.

22. What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?
