1. You're building an agent with tools. Which approach will give Claude the most flexibility to handle unexpected requests?

- Give Claude only one powerful tool
- Provide very specific tools like "write_python_function" and "debug_code"
- ✅ Provide abstract tools like "read_file", "write_file", and "run_command"
- Provide tools that only work for planned scenarios

2. You want Claude to write a report, then check if it's good enough, and improve it if needed. What pattern are you using?

- Chaining workflow
- ✅ Evaluator-Optimizer pattern
- Parallelization workflow
- Routing workflow

3. Your app generates different types of social media content. Programming topics need educational scripts, while sports topics need entertainment-focused content. What pattern should you use?

- ✅ Route requests to specialized processing pipelines
- Use the same prompt for everything
- Ask users to write their own content
- Always use the entertainment approach

4. Claude keeps ignoring some of your rules when you give it a long prompt with many requirements. What workflow approach would help?

- Make the prompt even longer with more rules
- Run everything in parallel
- Use a routing workflow to categorize first
- ✅ Chain the task into focused sequential steps

5. You need Claude to recommend the best material for a part by considering metal, plastic, ceramic, and wood options. Each material has different criteria. What's the best approach?

- Chain the evaluations one after another
- Ask Claude to pick randomly
- ✅ Send separate requests for each material type in parallel
- Put all criteria in one big prompt

6. You need to choose between a workflow and an agent for your app. Reliability and predictable results are most important to you. Which should you pick?

- Always use an agent for maximum flexibility
- ✅ Use a workflow since it's more reliable and testable
- Combine both approaches equally
- Use whichever is easier to code

7. You're building an app where users upload photos of damaged car parts and always get repair cost estimates. You know exactly what steps are needed each time. What should you use?

- Multiple agents working together
- A single complex prompt
- An agent with many specialized tools
- ✅ A workflow with predetermined steps
